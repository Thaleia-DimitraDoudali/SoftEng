How user registration works:

Sip Communicator - press 
	SipCommunicator.java (main) -> calls sipManager.startRegisterProcess() -> calls securityAuthority.obtainCredentials() which is 
	implemented in SipCommunicator.java -> if (guiManager.shouldRegister()) then obtainCredentialsAndRegister(); ->
	shows RegistrationSplash window and registers user to database
	
	The sipmanager during register process calls getCredentials. This
depending on the registration state (should or should not register)
calls the equivalent method in order to show the register panel or
not.


sipmanager->startregisterprocess() -> state getcredentials

sipmanager->setsecurityauthority->regstate=onlylogin

if user not exists:
	login redirects to register
	register works ok
if user exits
	login works ok
	register shouldn't work..->check done on obtainCredentialsAndRegister
	
Proxy's side:
	Registrar.java: dbManager.checkRegister(username) if username already on database then register request returns not_found ->
	on sip communicator SipManager.java when we get a not_found response from register request we do the following:
	according to reg state the proper getcredentials will be called
